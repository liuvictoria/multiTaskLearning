# Multi-Task Learning for Accelerated MR Reconstruction

This repository contains the source code of multi-task and baseline variational networks from our manuscript, "Multi-Task Accelerated MR Reconstruction Schemes for Jointly Training Multiple Contrasts", introduced by [Victoria Liu](https://liuvictoria.github.io/), [Kanghyun Ryu](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=w5SLrr6uQq0C&hl=ko), [Cagan Alkan](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Cagan_Alkan1), [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/), and [Shreyas Vasanawala](http://bodymri.stanford.edu/shreyasvasanawala). The manuscript is currently under review for the 2021 NeuIPS Deep Inverse Workshop and will be publicly available after October 15, 2021; please check back soon. In the meantime, here is our abstract and an MTL network visualization.

## Abstract

Model-based accelerated MRI reconstruction methods leverage large datasets to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from undersampled k-space. These networks require matching training and test time distributions to achieve high quality recon- structions. However, there is inherent variability in MR datasets, including different contrasts, orientations, anatomies, and institution-specific protocols. The current paradigm is to train separate models for each dataset. However, this is a demanding process and cannot exploit information that may be shared amongst datasets. To address this issue, we propose multi-task learning (MTL) schemes that can jointly reconstruct multiple datasets. We test multiple MTL architectures and weighted loss functions against single task learning (STL) baselines. Our quantitative and qualitative results suggest that MTL can outperform STL across a range of dataset ratios for two knee contrasts.

## Setup
- Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/liuvictoria/multitasklearning.git
```

- Create a virtual environment using `conda-env.txt`. Install packages in `requirements.txt`

- Download MRI data from [mridata.org](http://mridata.org/list?project=NYU%20machine%20learning%20data). We use the PDw and PDw-FS coronal volumes.

## Usage

In the multiTaskLearning folder, you'll be able to run STL, transfer learning, MTL, and evaluation experiments from the command line. There are required and optional user-defined values that are passed in as flags. Here are some examples:

#### STL Joint training

```
python3 stl.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs div_coronal_pd --epochs 120 --experimentname STL_joint --savefreq 10 --device cuda:2 --scarcities 1 2 3
```

#### STL Non-joint training
```
python3 stl.py --datasets div_coronal_pd --epochs 120 --experimentname STL_nojoint --savefreq 10 --device cuda:2 --scarcities 1 2 3 --mixeddata 0
```

#### MTL multi-head, uncertainty training
```
python3 mtl.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs div_coronal_pd --weighting uncert --blockstructures trueshare trueshare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare mhushare --epochs 120 --experimentname MTL_uncert_mhushare --device cuda:2 --scarcities 1 2 3 --savefreq 10
```

#### MTL split, naive training
```
python3 mtl.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs div_coronal_pd --weighting naive --blockstructures trueshare trueshare split split split split split split split split split split --epochs 120 --experimentname MTL_naive_split --device cuda:1 --scarcities 1 2 3 --savefreq 10
```

#### Transfer learning
```
python3 stl.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs --epochs 120 --experimentname STL_transfer5e-4 --savefreq 10 --device cuda:1 --scarcities 1 2 3 --lr 0.0005 --weightsdir /mnt/dense/vliu/summer_runs_models/models/STL_baselines/STL_nojoint_varnet_div_coronal_pd/N=481_l1.pt --mixeddata 0
```

#### Evaluation for split, naive network
```
python3 evaluate.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs div_coronal_pd --stratified 0 --network varnet --shareetas 1 --mixeddata 1 --scarcemax 497 --device cuda:1 --plotdir neurips/MTL_naive_split_varnetIIVVVVVVVVVV_div_coronal_pd_fs_div_coronal_pd --experimentnames MTL_naive_split --blockstructures IIVVVVVVVVVV --showbaselines 1
```

In addition, there is a script to delete aborted runs (usually due to GPU issue) and a script to visualize the undersampled images before any training:

```
python3 deleteDuplicateRuns.py --runnames MTL_uncert_gradacc_varnetIIYYYYYYYYYY_div_coronal_pd_fs_div_coronal_pd --rundir ../../../mnt/dense/vliu/runs/one_eta_pdfs_scarce
```

```
python3 getusamp.py --datasets div_coronal_pd_fs div_coronal_pd --device cuda:2 --plotdir usamp
```

The ESPIRiT folder contains scripts to estimate sensitivity maps.

At the inference step, you can also scroll through entire MRI volumes to see how reconstruction affects different slices.
